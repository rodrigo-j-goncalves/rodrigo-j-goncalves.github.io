## What is this

- `further-reading` is a Quarto extension to be used with [revealjs](https://quarto.org/docs/presentations/revealjs/) format.
- It takes all external links (used in the presentation) and list them in a single slide at the end of the presentation.

## Minimum example 

In the next slides we'll use several links. 

- The [`further-reading`](https://github.com/rodrigo-j-goncalves/further-reading/) extension collects all the external links and list them (see last slide)
- Only *external links*^[links to outside this presentation] are considered:
  - https, http, ftp
  - We could add more (let me know)
  
## Euler

Do you know who [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler) was?

## Laplace

And did you know [Laplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace) (who wrote about [celestial mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait%C3%A9_de_m%C3%A9canique_c%C3%A9leste)) 

once said,

"Read Euler, read Euler, he is the master of us all"?
