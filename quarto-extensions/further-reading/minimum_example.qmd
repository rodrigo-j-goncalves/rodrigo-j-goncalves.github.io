## Further-reading extension

In the next slides we'll use several links.

- Only external links^[links to outside this presentation] are considered

## Euler

Do you know who [Leonhard Euler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonhard_Euler) was?

## Laplace

And did you know [Laplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pierre-Simon_Laplace) (who wrote about [celestial mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trait%C3%A9_de_m%C3%A9canique_c%C3%A9leste)) 

once said,

"Read Euler, read Euler, he is the master of us all"?
